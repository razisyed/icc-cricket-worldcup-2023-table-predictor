# ICC Cricket Worldcup 2023 Table/Points Predictor

Every Cricket World Cup, ICC usually has a points predictor game where you can select the winner of each game, and then it adjusts the points table for you. This way you can see and analyze scenarios your team needs to win. 

However, for some reason, this year ICC didn't add this on their website or on the app. I couldn't find one either, so I just wrote my own in simple html and js, with some help from ChatGPT :)
